Stellaris mod that adds more options when it comes to customizing and specializing your military. Intended to mesh seamlessly with vanilla, not break anything and also be compatible with the AI. Currently WIP, only ship specialization works.

TODO:
  - Fill out offensive and defensive policies
  - Add events to show that the policies are accessible
  - Connect the policies to vanilla technologies
  - Add AI integration
